# lifelayer.org
 I developed lifelayer.org, a responsive website using Vue.js for an interactive frontend, Node.js for a robust backend, and Bootstrap 5 for modern, mobile-friendly design. This project highlights my full-stack development skills, combining seamless user interfaces with efficient server-side functionality.
